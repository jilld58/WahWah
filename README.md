# WahWah
This is an application for a real-time wah wah effect.

"ViewController.swift" is the main code for this project.

In order to run this application, download the zip file and open "finaleffect1.xcodeproj"

In the menu bar, select "Product --> Run" or select the "Build and Run Current Scheme" button (looks like a play button) to build project. 

On the simulator, you can control:
1. Speed of LFO

The "WahWah.pd" file is the Pure Data patch for the effect.
